# The '<' symbol in Ruby means that a class inherits all the features of another class
class Comedian < Person

  # Define a custom version of the hello method for comedians - Comedian objects
  # will use this version instead of the parent version
  # This is called 'overriding' the method from the base class.

     # from the same class
